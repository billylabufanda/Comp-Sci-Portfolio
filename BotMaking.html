    <h3>Fighting Bots</h3>
    <p>
                For the last interval of Expeditions, our class coded fighting bots. 
                Once in the arena, we had no control over what they would do. It was all up to what we coded.
    </p>
    <h3>The Arena</h3>
    <p>
        The maps were randomly generated, with arbitrary numbers of mines, taverns, and obstacles. You fight 3 other
        The mines collect one gold per turn, taverns take 2 gold but give you 50 health (you start with 100), and 
        obstacles do nothing but make it harder to navigate the map. Players can take 20 points, and can own mines 
        that take 20 health to capture. There are 1200 turns, and each player takes one turn, so each person gets 300 total turns.a There are 1200 turns, and each player takes one turn    My bot was based on a system of inclinations: Hunger, Greed, and Murder. If Hunger was strongest, I would go 
        to the closest tavern. If Greed was strongest, I would go to the closest free mine, or if it was more than 
        double the distance from the closest taken mine, I would go there. If Murder was strongest, I would go to 
        the closest enemy player. Which was strongest depended on how close I was to a tavern, mine, or player, and 
        how my health and wealth were doing.    , so each per
    <h3>Some of My Code</h3>
    <p>
        This code finds the closest of either a free mine, enemy mine, tavern, or enemy player and goes to that position:
        <pre><code> 
                var placeChooser = function(place) {
                console.log(place);
                var closestPlace = place[0];
                for(i = 0; i < place.length; i++) {
                    if(bot.findDistance(myPos, closestPlace) > bot.findDistance(myPos, place[i])) {
                        closestPlace = place[i];
                    }
                }
                console.log("this is the closest place"+ closestPlace+ "this is my pos" + myPos)
                bot.goDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestPlace);
        </code> </pre>
