    <h3>Fighting Bots</h3>
    <p>
                For the last interval of Expeditions, our class coded fighting bots. 
                Once in the arena, we had no control over what they would do. It was all up to what we coded.
    </p>
    <h3>The Arena</h3>
    <p>
        The maps were randomly generated, with arbitrary numbers of mines, taverns, and obstacles. You fight 3 other
        The mines collect one gold per turn, taverns take 2 gold but give you 50 health (you start with 100), and 
        obstacles do nothing but make it harder to navigate the map. Players can take 20 points, and can own mines 
        that take 20 health to capture.
    </p>
    <h3>How My Bot Worked</h3>
    <p>
        
    </p>
    <p>
        For the last interval of Expeditions, our class coded fighting bots. 
        We had a server where these bots would duel, competing for who could collect the most gold. 
        The maps were randomly generated, with arbitrary numbers of mines, which were how you collected resources, taverns for healing, and obstacles to make it harder to maneuver. It was turn based, every turn allowing for moving, collecting a mine, or going to a tavern. You lose 1 of your 100 health every turn, getting attacked takes 20 health every hit, and a tavern heals 50 health in exchange for 2 gold. Mines give you 1 gold per turn.
