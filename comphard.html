            <p>I am going to be talking about the major hardware in a ocmputer. Hardware is the physical part of a computer. I am going to go over the motherboard, the CPU, RAM, what harddrives are, what a power supply is, how the different parts communicate, and what peripherals are and what they do.</p>

            <h3 class="header">What's a Motherboard?</h3>
            <p>A motherboard, or mobo, is the main component of a computer. It contains the CPU, which we will go over later. It also has sockets for peripherals, which will also be gone over later. It also contains memory, which is where the computer stores collected data. However, the majority of the memory is stored on a harddrive. It also contains RAM, which will be discussed later. Video and sound cards are part of it, however, it is better to have external video and audio drives as the ones ingrained inthe CPU are extremely basic. As you can see, all the parts of a computer, from the RAM to the peripherals, connect and communicate through the mother board. These communications happen in binary. The mother board is given a series of electrical pulses, either on or off, which corresponds to a certin task or file. Then, the motherboard routes that information to the part of the computer that needs it.Here is a picture of a stereotypical motherboard:</p>

            <h3 class="header">What's the CPU?</h3>
            <p>The Central Processing Unit, or CPU, is, in layman's terms, the brains of the computer. It performs all tasks, and calls on the RAM and memory to appropriately finish a task. An ordinary CPU looks similar to this:</p>

        <div id="RAMabout">
            <h3 class="header">What is RAM?</h3>
            <p>Random Access Memory, or RAM, is the short term memory of a computer. The time for the CPU to edit RAM is the same amount of time it takes for it to read it, which is different than regular, more permanent memory. However, this memory is not permanently stored. RAM is also how multiple prpgrams can be run. Consider the following example: I am on my computer at home, and wish to play a video gae, for this example we shall use Minecraft, and also wish to use Skype and to have Google Chrome opens. RAM is the hardware that remembers where in the game I am, and what is going on. It also allows the computer to consistently remember what Skype and Chrome are doing. Because each of these requires constant RAM usage, the more RAM you have, the more programs you can run simultaneuosly. An example of what RAM look slike is below:</p>

            <h3 class="header">What is a hardrive?</h3>
            <p>A harddrive is the major stoarge of permenant data of information in a computer. It uses random-access, which means blocks of data can be retrieved and stored in any order. Unlike RAM, a harddrive retains its information after the cmputer shuts down. A hardrive also holds huge quanitities of data compared to the data storage of the motherbaord or RAM, as some computers can have harddrives holding up to a terabyte, which is a thousnd bytes, while most RAM chips can only hold 8 or 32 gigabytes. Below is an image of a hard drive:</p>

            <h3 class="header">What is a power supply?</h3>
            <p>The power supply is what supplies electricity to the computer. This is required to keeping the computer working. If you have a more powerful computer, a better power supply must be used. Here is a regular power supply:</p>

        <div id="peripheralsabout">
            <h3 class="header">What are peripherals?</h3>
            <p>Peripherals are the parts of a computer which people use to input or export data from the computer. These include the monitor, the keyboard, and the mouse. The monitor is the screen which shows you what the computer is doing. The keyboard is the most basic way to interact with the computer. It uses a typewriter-like system of mechanical levers to communicate with the computer. Each lever, which are more commonly known as keys, corresponds to a written symbol, and is engraved as such. For example, the key which has an A engraved in it corresponds to an A in the computer. This peripheral is the oldest one. One of the other major peripherals is the mouse. The mouse is a hand held object which is used to interact with the software of the computer via the monitor. When you move the mouse, a virtual mouse on the monitor moves similarly. The monitor is the most important visual peripheral. It shows visually what the computer is doing, from files open to playing video games. It is how a user can see what the keyboard and mouse are doing in relation to the computer. Here is a mouse, a keyboard, and a monitor: </p>
