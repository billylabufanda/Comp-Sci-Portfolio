                 <h4 style="font-family:Arial;">On Martial Arts</h4>
                <p>I have been participating at Kuk Sool Won, a martial art, since third grade. I have recently started instructing there as well. I am a first degree black belt. I have been taught grappling, sparring, simple gymnastics, and use with weapons. By first degree, I have been taught 200 different grappling techniques. Instructing generally includes leading the children through warm-ups, which takes about 15 minutes, and them through their forms or through the gymnastics.</p>

            <h4 style="font-family:Arial;">My Favorite Book</h4>
            <p>My favorite book is Worm. Worm is a fantasy novel taking place on an alternative Earth. There, certain people develop powers while going through especially traumatic experiences. The protagonist, a high schooler named Taylor, has the ability to control invertebrates. This novel is particularaly interesting because it excellently shows how the people the media and whatnot portray as heroes or villians are capable of both heoric and villianous acts. It is also extremely long, at 1.5 million words, or the length of the entire A Song of Ice and FIre series. </p>

            <p id="asciibod">Ascii is the translation of the alphabet and other basic parts of speech into binary. For my class, I have created a sentence in ascii about me(I had to split it up every byte due to size issues):01001001 00100000 01100001 01101101 00100000 01101001 01101110 00100000 01100011 01101100 01100001 01110011 01110011 00100000 01101111 01100110 00100000 01100100 01101111 01100111 01100101 00101110</p>
